<h1>MOTIVATION TOWARDS ONLINE CLASS</h1>
<h2><i>How I Motivate Myself During Online Class</i></h2>

<p>First of all I need to think the reasons why I'm in University. The reason could be I want a better job, preparing for a new career field or want to earn a credential such as a degree holder. I will have an easier time staying on track whenever I remind myslef like this</p>

<p>The second one is I will create a sensible schedule which is it helps to keep your goals realistic. It might help to make a list of everything I have going on from online courses to family and social time</p>

<p>In order to keep myself motivate, I will reward myself. Accomplishing a goal or completing a project feels great. By doing something nice for myself can create even more internal motivation.</p>

<p>Last but not least always stay positive! It is not easy to turn a negative attitude into a positive outlook, it will definitely help you keep going when you want a procrastinate on an assignment or do not feel like logging into attend a lecture. If you try to stay positive throughout your online course experience, you will find it makes everything a little easier</p>
