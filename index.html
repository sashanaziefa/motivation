<h1>MOTIVATION TOWARDS ONLINE CLASS</h1>
<h2><i>How I Motivate Myself During Online Class</i></h2>

<p>First of all I need to think the reasons why I'm in University. The reason could be I want a better job, preparing for a new career field or want to earn a credential such as a degree holder. I will have an easier time staying on track whenever I remind myslef like this</p>

<p>The second one is I will create a sensible schedule which is it helps to keep my goals realistic. It might help to make a list of everything I have going on from online courses to family and social time</p>

<p>In order to keep myself motivate, I will reward myself. Accomplishing a goal or completing a project feels great.For example, when you are done doing a certain assignments, you should reward yourself such as food or buy something from online or maybe you can do your favorite hobby. By doing something nice for myself can create even more internal motivation.</p>

<p>Last but not least always stay positive! It is not easy to turn a negative attitude into a positive outlook, it will definitely help me keep going when I want a procrastinate on an assignment or do not feel like logging into attend a lecture. If I keep on trying to stay positive throughout my online course experience, I will find it makes everything a little easier</p>

<p>The most important thing in this online session, always think that there is more people need to go through hard times compared to us. I will always try to avoid myself from stress because once you stressed out all the works given will never be completed smoothly and the best thing is do all works on time.</p>
